# Generator = Function that behaves like an iterator (it can be used in a for loop)
#                      Pauses a function, returns a value, then resumes
#                      Uses 'yield' instead or 'return'
#                      Iterate without loading everything into memory (ex. reading large files)
#                      return = Pouring bucket
#                      yield = Drip faucet

# ---------- EXAMPLE 1 ----------

def count_to(n):
   count = 1
   while count <= n:
       yield count  # Pause here and return the current value
       count += 1

number = int(input("Enter a number to count up to: "))

for n in count_to(number):
   print(n)
